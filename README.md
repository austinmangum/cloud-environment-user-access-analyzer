# cloud-environment-user-access-analyzer
An app that queries AWS and GCP then generates reports showing which users have access to which resources. 

These scripts are meant to be run locally for ease of deployment and cost savings during initial deployment.

To run the scripts properly, you must know the AWS account and GCP project you want to scan. Please ensure your local environment is set up and that you have already authenticated with GCP or AWS before running the scripts. 

After using the scripts, please provide feedback by creating a Branch of this repository and proposing any changes you want to see. you can also report any problems or requests through this Github Repo. 

When the scripts are  done, they will produce a CSV file that can be viewed using your chosen viewer. Please provide feedback on the layout and design of the Sheet. This feedback will later be implemented into the Schema of the database that will be used.
