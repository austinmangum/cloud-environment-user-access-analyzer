# Cloud Environment User Access Analyzer (CEUAA)

## Introduction

Welcome to the Cloud Environment User Access Analyzer (CEUAA) GitHub repository! CEUAA is a powerful tool designed to help you implement least access principles and enhance security best practices within your cloud environment. This README provides essential information on how to use CEUAA, why it's crucial for maintaining robust security, and how you can contribute to its development.

## Least Access and Security Best Practices

**Least Access Principle**: CEUAA is built around the core concept of least access, which means granting users or entities only the permissions they need to perform their tasks. Adhering to this principle reduces the attack surface, minimizes potential security risks, and improves overall security posture.

**Security Best Practices**: CEUAA incorporates industry-standard security best practices to ensure your cloud resources' confidentiality, integrity, and availability. It actively identifies areas where security practices may fall short and provides actionable insights to rectify them.

## Identifying Overprivileged Users

CEUAA offers a valuable feature to help you identify users with excessive access privileges. By uploading a spreadsheet containing a comprehensive list of users and their associated permissions, CEUAA performs an in-depth analysis. It then generates clear, user-friendly reports highlighting individuals or entities with privileges that exceed what's necessary for their roles.
